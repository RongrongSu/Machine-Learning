# machine-learning

In this repo I implemented machine learning and deep learning algorithms with bulit-in libraries to solve queations such as fashion-mnist image classification, credit card fraud detection, iris calssification.

# Customers leaving tend prediction

This project is aim to provide insights for the company in predicting the chance of a customer leaving the company. The original dataset is obtained from a Chinese Machine Learning competition held by a local telecommunication company. The variables after feature engineering are caller ID, the number of callers contacted (callersum), total number of calling records (recordsum) and calling duration (timesum). The target is whether or not a customer ends contract. 

# Fashion-mnist classification

In this project, I introduce three boosting algorithms, which are AdaBoost algorithm, Gradient Boosting algorithm and XGBoost. Then based on fashion-mnist dataset, I implement these three algorithms and evaluate their performances.
